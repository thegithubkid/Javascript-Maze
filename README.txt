Our project is worth full credit for a couple reasons. One, for our attempt to make a decent AI for our game, it's not the best but it works. Two, our pretty cool looking website and color changing board. And three, one of our team members is not a CS major so we had to spend some time teaching him how things work and how to use git. Because he had never used git we had the oppertunity to do a lot of pair programming but doing work outside of school was difficult. We really did the best we could with all of our schedule conflicts and time constraints.
